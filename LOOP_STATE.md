## Current loop
- **Loop #:** 10 — **B-10 Local persistence (AsyncStorage + Zustand persist)**
- **Goal of this loop:** Persist onboarding/plan/progress/history/body-weights/recommendations across reloads; gate hydration (no onboarding flicker); reset utility. Live session NOT persisted. Local only.
- **Success condition:** Data survives reload; onboarding skipped after completion; Today shows correct next workout; history/weights/recs persist; live session not restored broken; typecheck + persistence assertions pass.
- **Ceiling:** Max 3 fix attempts. (Used: 0 — passed on first checker pass.)
- **Status:** ✅ Complete — awaiting approval for B-11.

## Reprioritized sequence (per D12 — auth moved late)
Onboarding ✅ → Plan generation ✅ → Today ✅ → Workout overview ✅ → Guided session + set logging ✅ → Trainer recommendations ✅ → Progress dashboard ✅ → Adaptive next-workout ✅ → Multi-day navigation/progression ✅ → Local persistence ✅ → **next: B-11 (TBD)** → *then* Auth + Supabase sync.

## Next task (single, after approval) — user to choose B-11
> Per the loop rule: pick ONE item from FEATURE_BACKLOG.md, write a mini-spec, build, check, update this file, STOP.
- **Candidate A:** Exercise Library screen (B-21) — browse all machines (read-only) from the catalog, search/filter, detail view. Local only.
- **Candidate B:** Weekly check-in flow (B-20) — weight/energy/soreness entry + week summary (local).
- **Candidate C:** Settings/profile build-out (B-22) — edit profile, update injuries → regenerate safe plan, restart plan, unit toggle.
- **Candidate D:** Begin Auth + Supabase sync (deferred D12) — first real backend wiring.
- Awaiting user direction on B-11 scope.

## Decisions log
| # | Decision | Rationale | Date |
|---|----------|-----------|------|
| D1 | RN + Expo managed | Fastest path to device, OTA updates | 2026-06-28 |
| D2 | Supabase over custom backend | Auth + DB + Storage + RLS in one, connector-ready | 2026-06-28 |
| D3 | Rule-based trainer FIRST, AI later behind interface | De-risk MVP, no LLM cost/latency dependency | 2026-06-28 |
| D4 | Zustand for session state | Live set-by-set state is local & ephemeral | 2026-06-28 |
| D5 | Imperial (lb) default | PF is US-centric; unit toggle deferred (see Q2) | 2026-06-28 |
| D6 | Q1: **Soft-unlock** Week 2, never hard-block | Beginners shouldn't be locked out; <3 workouts → allow Week 2 but recommend repeating Week 1 | 2026-06-28 |
| D7 | Q2: **Imperial-first UI**, kg/cm canonical storage, convert at edge; kg/lb toggle later | PF machines show lb; keep math/charts consistent | 2026-06-28 |
| D8 | Q3: **Placeholder image system** via resolver (`getExerciseImage(slug)`) | Swap to licensed/custom illustrations later with zero screen/component changes | 2026-06-28 |
| D9 | Q4: Keep **"FirstRep"** as temporary name | — | 2026-06-28 |
| D10 | Body metrics canonical **kg/cm**; lift loads in **lb** — ✅ CONFIRMED by user | PF lb-first; 5 lb beginner progression. Sign-off received. | 2026-06-28 |
| D11 | **No Supabase provisioning yet** | Keep building UI/logic on local state until core flow feels right | 2026-06-28 |
| D12 | **Auth deferred** until after onboarding + plan-gen + Today + workout guide + set logging | Validate the core beginner experience before adding accounts | 2026-06-28 |
| D13 | Onboarding/session use **Zustand** local stores (no persistence yet) | Matches stack; persistence + Supabase sync come with auth loop | 2026-06-28 |

## Open questions (need user input)
| # | Question | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| Q1 | Week 2 gating | ✅ RESOLVED → soft-unlock + recommend repeat if <3 (D6) |
| Q2 | Units | ✅ RESOLVED → imperial-first UI, kg/cm canonical (D7) |
| Q3 | Machine images | ✅ RESOLVED → placeholder resolver system (D8) |
| Q4 | App name | ✅ RESOLVED → keep "FirstRep" (D9) |

## Bugs / issues
- None yet (no code).

## Blockers
